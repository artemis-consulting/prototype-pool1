Project Overview
================
Artemis Consulting kicked off our agile project named "FDA Drug Monitor" by assembling the project team and discussing the 18F opportunity/problem statement. This statement describes the current business scenario that creates the need for this project. We decided on the following statement: “We will produce a usable, mobile-friendly and accessible public website using OpenFDA's APIs for drugs, and win one of the BPAs in the process”. 

Next, we created a concise vision statement to ensure that the solution meets the intended product owner’s and users’ goals. This shared Vision Statement also helped to keep our team focused: "To deliver a fast, responsive and intuitive API-driven website using the Drug Labels API, Adverse Events API and Enforcement Actions API that integrates information  for the public and other potential users in a holistic fashion, within the next 6 days".

Team and Stakeholders
=====================
* Project leader (Product Owner) – Rohit G.
* Scrum master – Jim T.
* Backend developer – Risa O.
* Front end – Stephanie S.
* UX – Hoa P.
* Web design – David N.
* DevOps – Jay M.

The team decided on nominating Rohit as the project leader based on his qualifications and the technical product manager (TPM) role he performs on the Congress.gov contract. Under normal circumstances, 18F would be considered key stakeholders. However, due to the nature of this RFP, Artemis management is fulfilling this function with Rohit performing the role of ‘Product Owner’. 

His responsibilities include:

* Ensuring the service will meet the needs of its prospective users
* Ensuring that key features are built
* Managing the features and defect backlogs on a daily basis
* Setting priorities and providing the definition of "done" 
[Pool 1, requirement A, B and Play 6 ]

The team members assembled for this project are experts in their respective disciplines. [Pool 1, requirement A and Play 7 ]

During the story planning meetings, the following prospective users where identified:
* Public users
* Doctors 
* Pharmacists 
* Attorneys 
* FDA SMEs/employees 
* Federal regulators and watchdog agencies
* State regulators

User-Centered Design 
====================
We follow an integrated ‘User-Centered Design’ process where we strongly encourage end-users to shape how the final system is developed. For the FDA project, we decided on the following UCD techniques (mainly due to time constraints): 
* user personas 
* user journeys 
* usability testing 
* interviews 
* expert reviews 
* clickable prototypes.

The team strongly felt that applying the UCD techniques in the sections previously mentioned satisfy Play [1] and [2].

Wireframes
----------
Our team created an initial set of wireframes based on brainstorming with the product owner.  These can be seen [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool1/tree/master/user-centered-design/3-user-interface/wireframes)

Mobile-first Responsive Design
------------------------------
Our HTML experts created multiple functioning web prototypes throughout the course of the design phase. These were used for Accessibility testing and usability testing. 
The prototypes with accompanying HTML markup are available at:
* [Initial responsive web prototype using Bootstrap](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool1/tree/master/html/1-initial-bootstrap-version)
* [Second responsive and accessible web prototype](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool1/tree/master/html/2-intermediate-version)
* [Final responsive and accessible web prototype](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool1/tree/master/html/3-final-version)

Formal Accessibility Review
---------------------------
Our team conducted a fairly formal accessibility review with the initial web prototype. The results of this review are [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool1/blob/master/user-centered-design/3-user-interface/accessibility/FDA%20Drug%20Monitor%20Formal%20Accessibility%20Review.pdf).

Usability Testing
-----------------
Agile usability testing was integrated into the design and prototyping process so that the team could identify and fix user experience problems before they become baked in and expensive to address.  To view the results the usability testing conducted on 06/24/14, click [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool1/blob/master/SUPPORTING_DOC.md#section-pool1-ucd)

Agile Delivery Approach
=======================
For the FDA prototype, we decided on 2-day sprints but chose to add a 4-day sprint to accommodate the unusual nature of this project and weekend work after the project deadline was extended.

Results of usability testing can be viewed here For automated testing, we used Selenium. The scripts for these tests are checked in here.

Technologies used:
=================

* Less/CSS
* JavaScript/jQuery 
* Photoshop
* Bootstrap/Bootswatch Paper theme 
* Highcharts chart and mapping widgets 
* (Proprietary) accessibility toolkit
